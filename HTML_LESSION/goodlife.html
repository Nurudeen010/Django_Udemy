    <h1>How to be happy</h1>
    <p>
        Behavioral scientists have spent a lot of time studying what makes us happy (and what doesn’t). 
        We know happiness can predict health and longevity, and happiness scales can be used to measure social progress and the success of public policies. 
        But happiness isn’t something that just happens to you. 
        Everyone has the power to make small changes in our behavior, our surroundings and our relationships that can help set us on course for a happier 
        life.

    <h2>Conquer Negative Thinking</h2>
    <p>
        All humans have a tendency to be a bit more like Eeyore than Tigger, to ruminate more on bad experiences than positive ones.
        It’s an evolutionary adaptation — over-learning from the dangerous or hurtful situations we encounter through life (bullying, trauma, betrayal) helps us avoid them in the future and react quickly in a crisis.
